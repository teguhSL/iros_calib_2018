\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we have proposed SCALAR, a method to simultaneously calibrate a 6-\ac{dof} robot's kinematic parameters and a 2D \ac{lrf} extrinsic parameters using only three flat planes, arranged perpendicular towards each other around the robot. SCALAR is easier to implement than the previous methods in the literature as it does not require other expensive measurement system or tedious setup. Through simulations, we have also verified that the method can reduce the average errors in position and orientation from (14.6mm, 4.05$^o$) to (0.09mm, 0.02$^o$), respectively. This is very useful for many industrial robotics applications that require great accuracy. 

The next step after this is to implement SCALAR on the real system. Some challenges that may appear on the real system are the backlash of the robot's transmission system, the elasticity of the joints, the roughness of the calibration planes and the noises of the \ac{lrf} data which will reduce the calibration accuracy. Moreover, evaluating the calibration errors in the real system is not as easy as in simulation. We will present the calibration result on the real system in our future work.
