abstract = {The absolute accuracy of an ABB IRB 1600 industrial robot is improved using a 29-parameter calibration model, developed after extensive experimentation. The error model takes into account all possible geometric errors (25 geometric error parameters to be identified through optimization, in addition to the pose parameters for the base and tool frames and four error parameters related to the compliance in joints 2, 3, 4 and 5). The least squares optimization technique is used to find the 29 error parameters that best fit the measures acquired with a laser tracker. Contrary to most other similar works, the validation of the robot's accuracy is performed with a very large number of measures (1,000) throughout the complete robot's joint space. After calibration, the mean/maximum position errors at any of eight different measurement points on the end-effector (all offset from axis 6 by approximately 120 mm) are reduced from 0.968 mm/2.158 mm respectively, to 0.364 mm/0.696 mm. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Model based error compensation of a robotic manipulator, also known as robot calibration, requires the identification of its generalized errors. These errors are found from measured data and used to predict, and compensate for, the end-point errors as a function of configuration. However, the generalized error formulation introduces redundant parameters, often non-intuitive, that may compromise the robustness of the calibration. The existing numerical methods to eliminate such errors are formulated on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, the general analytical expressions and physical interpretation of the redundant parameters are developed for any serial link manipulator, expressed through its Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. These expressions are used to eliminate the redundant parameters from the error model of any manipulator prior to the identification process, allowing for systematic robot calibration with improved accuracy. Simulations are conducted to verify the theory presented in the paper},

abstract = {This paper describes an industrial robot joint offset calibration method called the virtual line-based single-point constraint approach. Previous methods such as using CMM, laser trackers or cameras are limited by the cost or the resolution. The proposed method relies mainly upon a laser pointer attached on the end-effector and single position-sensitive detector (PSD) arbitrarily located on the workcell. The automated calibration procedure (about three minutes) involves aiming the laser lines loaded by the robot towards the center of the PSD surface from various robot positions and orientations. The intersections of each pair of laser lines eventually should converge to the same point after compensating the joint offsets. An optimization model and algorithm have been formulated to identify the robot offset. For the highly precise feedback, a segmented PSD with a position resolution of better than 0.1 m is employed. The mean accuracy of robot localization is up to 0.02 mm, and the mean error of the parameter identification is less than 0.08 degrees. Both simulations and experiments implemented on an ABB industrial robot verify the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed calibration system. The goal of fast, automated, low-cost, and high precision offset calibration are achieved. 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {As a core robotic and vision problem, camera and range sensor calibration have been researched intensely over the last decades. However, robotic research efforts still often get heavily delayed by the requirement of setting up a calibrated system consisting of multiple cameras and range measurement units. With regard to removing this burden, we present a toolbox with web interface for fully automatic camera- to-camera and camera-to-range calibration. Our system is easy to setup and recovers intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters as well as the transformation between cameras and range sensors within one minute. In contrast to existing calibration approaches, which often require user intervention, the proposed method is robust to varying imaging conditions, fully automatic, and easy to use since a single image and range scan proves sufficient for most calibration scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed checkerboard corner detector significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the proposed camera-to-range registration method is able to discover multiple solutions in the case of ambiguities. Experi- ments using a variety of sensors such as grayscale and color cameras, the Kinect 3D sensor and the Velodyne HDL-64 laser scanner show the robustness of our method in different indoor and outdoor settings and under various lighting conditions.

abstract = {A robot kinematic calibration method based on the local frame representation of the product-of-exponentials (Local POE) formula is introduced. In this method, the twist coordinates of the joint axes are expressed in their respective local (body) frames. The advantages of this new approach are threefolds: (1) revolute and prismatic joints can be uniformly expressed in the twist coordinates based on the line geometry; (2) the twist coordinates of the joint axes can be set up with simple values because the local frames can be arbitrarily defined on the links; (3) the kinematic parameters described by the twist coordinates vary smoothly that makes the method robust and singularity-free. By assuming that the kinematic errors exist only in the relative initial poses of the consecutive link frames, the kinematic calibration models can be formulated in a simple and elegant way. The calibration process then becomes to re-define a set of new local link frames that are able to reflect the actual kinematics of the robot. This method can be applied to robot manipulators with generic open chain structures (serial or tree-typed). The simulation and experiment results on a 4-DOF SCARA type robot and a 5-DOF tree-typed modular robot have shown that the average positioning accuracy of the end-effector increases significantly after calibration. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Two examples are included in this paper . For this reason , this paper presents the topic and in- cludes the conditions for a complete and viable identification sists of nonlinear feedback and usual PD controller ( 1 d . o . f . controller ) is also shown in Fig . 4 by the dotted lines , where PD parameters are chosen to achieve the same command response as ours at the nominal . In this case , the deviation is much larger than ours . 4 Conclusion In this paper we have proposed a control method for robot manipulators which consists of linearization of robot dynamics and servo controller design using the concept of two-degree-of-freedom servo controller . We have discussed the specification of two design parameters of the servo con- troller , and have given a simulation result to show the validity of our approach . Our method can be readily extended to position / force hybrid control [ 11 ]. Introduction In this paper , the term manipulator refers to an open loop mechanism which is composed of a number of connected rigid bodies . Connections occur through joints . Each joint can be one of two types ; prismatic ( sliding or telescopic ), or revolute ( pin or hinge ). One body ( numbered body 0 ) is the ground}},

abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in todays industrial robotics is the development of off-line programming systems that allow drastic reduction in robots reprogramming time, improving productivity. The article purpose is to pave the way to the construction of generic calibration systems easily adapted to any type of robot, regardless their application, such as modular robots and robot controllers specifically designed for non-standard applications. A computer system was built for developing and implementing a calibration system that involves the joint work of computer and measurement systems. Each step of this systems development is presented together with its theoretical basis. With the development of a remote maneuvering system based on ABB S3 controller experimental tests have been carried out using an IRB2000 robot and a measurement arm (ITG ROMER) with 0.087 mm of position measurement accuracy. The robot model used by its controller was identified and the robot was calibrated and evaluated in different workspaces resulting in an average accuracy improvement from 1.5 mm to 0.3 mm.},
