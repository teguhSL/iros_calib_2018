Industrial robots are increasingly used in various applications where the robot accuracy becomes very important, hence calibrations of the robot's kinematic parameters and the measurement system's extrinsic parameters are required. However, the existing calibration approaches are either too cumbersome or require another expensive external measurement system such as laser tracker or measurement spinarm. In this paper, we propose SCALAR, a calibration method to simultaneously improve the extrinsic parameters of a 2D \ac{lrf}, attached to the robot, and the robot's kinematic parameters. Three flat planes are placed around the robot, and for each plane the robot moves to several poses such that the \ac{lrf}'s ray intersect the respective plane. Geometric planar constraints are then used to optimize the calibration parameters using Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear optimization algorithm. We demonstrate through simulations that SCALAR can reduce the position and orientation errors of the robot system from 21mm and 4$^o$ to 0.1mm and 0.02$^o$.
