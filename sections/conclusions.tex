\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have proposed a method to determine a near-optimal sequence to
visit $n$ targets with multiple configurations per target, also known
as the \acl{rtsp}. For a complex drilling task, which requires
visiting 245 targets with an average of 28.5 configurations per
target, our method could compute a high-quality solution in less than
a minute. To our knowledge, no existing approach could have solved the
same problem in practical times. We have also provided a carefully
benchmarked open-source software solution, which can be readily used
in complex, real-world, applications such as drilling, spot-welding or
spray-painting.
