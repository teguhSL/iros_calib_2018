abstract = {The absolute positioning accuracy of robot manipulator can be increased substantially by updating the nominal link parameters in the control software. This paper presents a general method to estimate the link parameter errors for any serial link manipulator (i.e., n linkes, and any combination of revolute and prismatic joints). The parameters are estimated through a linear kinematic model which relates the link bias errors to the end-effector positioning error. Only end-effector measurements are required instead of individual link measurements to implement this method.},

@article{Joubair2015,
abstract = {This paper describes a non-kinematic calibration method developed to improve the accuracy of a six-axis serial robot, in a specific target workspace, using planar constraints. Simulation confirms that the stiffness of the robot, as well as its kinematic parameters, can be identified. An experimental validation shows that the robot's accuracy inside the target workspace is significantly enhanced by reducing the maximum distance errors from 1.321 mm to 0.274 mm. The experimental data are collected using a precision touch probe, which is mounted on the flange of a FANUC LR Mate 200iC industrial robot, and a high precision 9-in. granite cube. The calibration method makes use of a linear optimization model based on the closed-loop calibration approach using multi-planar constraints. A practical validation approach designed to reliably evaluate the robot's accuracy after calibration is also proposed.},
