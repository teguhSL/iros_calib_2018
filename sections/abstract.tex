\begin{abstract}
  In many industrial robotics applications, such as spot-welding, spray-painting
  or drilling, the robot is required to visit successively multiple targets. The
  robot travel time among the targets is a significant component of the overall
  execution time. This travel time is in turn greatly affected by the order of
  visit of the targets, and by the robot configurations used to reach each
  target. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize these two elements, a problem
  known in the literature as the \ac{rtsp}. Our contribution in this paper is
  two-fold. First, we propose a fast, near-optimal, algorithm to solve
  \ac{rtsp}. The key to our approach is to exploit the classical distinction
  between task space and configuration space, which, surprisingly, has been so
  far overlooked in the \ac{rtsp} literature. Second, we provide an open-source
  implementation of the above algorithm, which has been carefully benchmarked to
  yield an efficient, ready-to-use, software solution. We discuss the
  relationship between \ac{rtsp} and other \ac{tsp} variants, such as the
  \ac{gtsp}, and show experimentally that our method finds motion sequences of
  the same quality but using several orders of magnitude less computation time
  than existing approaches.
