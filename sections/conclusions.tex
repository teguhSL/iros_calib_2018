\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we have proposed SCALAR, a method to simultaneously calibrate a 6-\ac{dof} robot's kinematic parameters and a 2D \ac{lrf}'s extrinsic parameters using only three flat planes, arranged perpendicularly towards each other around the robot. SCALAR is easier to implement than the previous methods in the literature as it does not require other expensive measurement systems or tedious setup. We have verified from simulations that the method reduces the average errors in position and orientation from (14.6 mm, 4.05$^o$) to (0.09 mm, 0.02$^o$), respectively. This is very useful for many industrial robotics applications that require great accuracy. 

The next step is to implement SCALAR on the real system. Some challenges that may appear on the real system are the backlash of the robot's transmission system, the elasticity of the joints, the roughness of the calibration planes and the noise of the \ac{lrf} data which will reduce the calibration accuracy. We will present the calibration result on the real system in our future work.
