\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we have proposed SCALAR, a method to simultaneously calibrate a 2D \ac{lrf} extrinsic parameters and a 6\ac{dof} robot kinematics by using just three flat planes, arranged perpendicularly towards each other around the robot. SCALAR is easier to implement than the previous methods in the literature as it does not require other expensive measurement system or tedious setup. Through the simulation, we have also verified that the method can reduce the errors in position and orientation from (21mm, 4$^o$) to (0.1mm, 0.02$^o$), respectively. This is very useful for many industrial robotics applications that require great accuracy. The method will be implemented on the real robot, and we will present the result in the next work.
